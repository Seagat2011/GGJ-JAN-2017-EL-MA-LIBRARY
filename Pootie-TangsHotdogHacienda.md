Pootie-Tang has just received a massive financial settlement of $ 000,000,030.00 after a marijuana-overdose due to a bad hand-off from Mt. Tom park rangers, and the one thing he's always wanted to do is open a restaurant -- which his accountant assures him he can't do, so he decides instead to start a hotdog stand  

During the game Pootie is presented with series of 1-4 tasks which the player must schedule and complete correctly by clicking upon them in the right order and at the right time  

The goal of the game is to get Pootie to complete his tasks without him cussing; in the event he is about to cuss, the game does a quick-cut-to gamejam credits and whimsical elevator music
