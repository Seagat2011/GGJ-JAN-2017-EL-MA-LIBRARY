NOTES

  -A war captain can play a battle-week or train. Training is broken down into 9 cats. Training improves playWeek performance, but streaks are broken
  -Rest players before they need, so they will not fail you in battle
  -Design the game so that streak cards must be well-played: iff smart, every game is winnable
  -Award wins for tracking the scoreboard, superior recruiting, appropriate rest, winning streaks, well-sorted lineups
